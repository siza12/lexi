luna is a powerful agent framework seamlessly integrated with the Dojo stack, empowering developers to bring their games and applications to life with intelligent, autonomous agents. Whether you need NPCs that feel truly alive, dynamic storytellers that craft compelling narratives, or natural language interfaces that let players interact with your world in intuitive ways - luna makes it possible.

luna enables your agents to:

- Act as believable NPCs with distinct personalities and behaviors
- Generate dynamic storylines and quests that adapt to player actions
- Provide natural language interfaces for intuitive world interaction
- Participate in games and challenges with human-like reasoning
- Create emergent gameplay through autonomous decision making
